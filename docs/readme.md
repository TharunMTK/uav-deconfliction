## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a UAV Strategic Deconfliction system that determines whether a primary UAV mission is safe given its mission window, while accounting for potential conflicts with other UAVs sharing the same airspace.

The system checks both **spatial** and **temporal** conflicts, returning clear/conflict status along with detailed explanations. It also provides **visualizations** and **animations** to illustrate UAV paths and conflicts.
